Dear everyone,</br>

It's my pleasure to announce 23andMe first therapeutic target: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).</br>

Heat shock protein 90 is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone that is involved in the post-translational folding and stability of proteins.  Inhibition of HSP90 leads to the degradation of known oncogenes, such as ERB-B2, BRAF, and BCR-ABL, and a number of HSP90 inhibitors are in active development for various cancer and inflammatory conditions (<a href='http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/TTD/ZFTTDDetail.asp?ID=TTDS00274' target='_blank'>TTD</a>).  </br>

In our database, we found a strong association with inflammatory traits like "sunburns" and "heartburn," in line with known functions of HSP90.  Other association between "sunburns" and other genes in the heat shock pathway such as CRISPR/Casp9 and DIABLO/Smac further corroborate our confidence in this target.  As I will explain more in an upcoming Feisty, we believe that this present a compelling case for further investigation and investment into potential uses of HSP90 inhibitors in sunburn prevention (i.e. sunscreen) and treatment (i.e. topical cream).</br>

We are now discussing with potential partners such as J&J and P&G to expedite the experiment in man.  I will keep you all posted as we make headways into this exciting journey.</br>

I hope you are as fervent about this discovery as I am.  If you are interested in learning more about HSP90, I advise you to read this aptly named article by Udai Banerji: "<a href='http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/15/1/9.long' target='_blank'>Heat Shock Protein 90 as a Drug Target: Some Like It Hot</a>."</br>
