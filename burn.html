Dear everyone,

It's my pleasure to announce 23andMe first therapeutic target: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).

Heat shock protein 90 is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone that is involved in the post-translational folding and stability of proteins.  Inhibition of HSP90 leads to the degradation of known oncogenes, such as ERB-B2, BRAF, and BCR-ABL, and a number of HSP90 inhibitors are in active development for various cancer and inflammatory conditions (TTD).  

In our database, we found a strong association with inflammatory traits like "sunburns" and "heartburn," in line with known functions of HSP90.  Other association between "sunburns" and other genes in heat shock pathway such as CRISPR/Casp9 and DIABLO/Smac further corroborate our confidence in this target (see the pathway diagram below).  As I will explain more in an upcoming Feisty, we believe that this present a compelling case for further investigation into potential uses of HSP90 inhibitors in sunburn prevention (i.e. sunscreen) and treatment (i.e. topical cream).

We are now discussing with potential partners such as J&J and P&G to expedite the experiment in man.  I will keep you all posted as we make headways into this exciting journey.

I hope you are as fervent about this discovery as I am.  If you are interested in learning more about HSP90, I advise you to read this aptly named article by Udai Banerji: "Heat Shock Protein 90 as a Drug Target: Some Like It Hot."

Best,
