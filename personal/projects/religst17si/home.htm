<h3 align="left" id="header"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p align="left"><em>Meditation Across Traditions </em>Offers both an academic and experiential approach to studying various Buddhist meditation traditions, including Burmese Vipassana, Chinese Pure Land, Tibetan Vajrayana and Japanese Zen. Examines the cultural and historical context of these traditions in addition to the study of their primary texts. Nine class meetings include five discussions on scholarly approaches to the study of meditation and four experiential meditation labs led by prominent meditation teachers of diverse traditions in the Bay Area.</p>
<h3 align="left" id="header">Course Format</h3>
<p align="left">The nine classes for the quarter will be divided into 4 units consisting of 2 classes each, plus 1 overview class at the beginning of the quarter.  </p>
<p align="left">The first unit will focus on Theravada vipassana meditation, the second on Chinese Pure Land meditation, the third on Japanese Zen meditation and the fourth on Tibetan Vajrayana meditation. The first class of each unit will feature an eminent teacher representing the tradition in focus, who will offer background into the tradition, allow students to experience the techniques in the classroom, and lead a discussion based on the modern texts relevant to the tradition. The second class of each unit will complement and contrast with the first by focusing on a discussion of the primary source texts and secondary texts which describe the historical and cultural context of the tradition in question. </p>
<p align="left">The cornerstone of this course lies in exploring the dissonance and critical differences between the historical and cultural contexts of the meditation traditions and their contemporary expression. By engaging both with the primary texts and scholarly literature about these traditions and with their contemporary exponents, students will begin to develop a critical capacity to evaluate the validity of historical and universal claims made about meditation and foster a wider appreciation for the broad array of practices, beliefs and worldviews that fall under the umbrella of "Buddhist meditation."</p>
