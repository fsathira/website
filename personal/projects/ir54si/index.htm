<h3 align="left" id="header">Course Description</h3>
<p align="left">In this class, you will learn about Thai culture and history. We will introduce you to thoughts that prevail in Thai society and values that the majority of Thai people hold dear. Thai students from Stanford-Thai Exchange Program will join us in the first few weeks of class to give us the perspective of Thai college students. Other topics include Thai culinary art and its history, social issues in Thailand, Thai politics, insurgency problems in southern Thailand, Thai history, Thai Buddhism, etc. We hope to give you a different view of the country than what you would get from a travel guide book (although we will make use of one in our course readings).</p>
<h3 align="left" id="header">Course Expectation</h3>
<p align="left">Our class meets on Wednesday for a total of 9 times. We expect you to come to at least 8 classes to get the credit. One more absent will require you to attend special events which will be informed in class. Since the class is based on discussion, we expect you to read the assigned reading materials for each week before coming to class and come to class with at least one question about the topic. The main assignment of the class is to make a presentation (up to 3 students per group) about Thailand, which could be based on the materials in this class and further research.</p>
<h3 align="left" id="header">Readings</h3>
<p align="left">No textbook is required. We will post the slides, links to video clips, handouts, and other course materials on the class's website. We would, however, recommend a few books that will help students gain more insight from the class materials and discussions.</p>

<h3 align="left" id="header">Note on the Stanford-Thai Exchange Program (STEP)</h3>
<p align="left">Six highly qualified Thai college students are selected every year to participate in the Stanford-Thai Exchange Program. They come to Stanford at the beginning of Spring quarter and stay for three weeks. During their time here at Stanford they are expected to work on a mini-project on a topic of their interest and audit classes as time allows. They will attend our first three classes. (Make friends with them and get their email addresses. They can be your tour guides when you are in Thailand!)</p>
