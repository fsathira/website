<h1 id="header">FAQ</h1>
<div align="left">
	<p id="emphasis">So your full name is Jarupon Sathirapongsasuti. Where do you get "Fah" from?</p>
	<p>It's a Thai custom for parents to name their kid a nickname separate from a first name.
	"Fah" is my "given" nick name.</p>
	<img src="./monk.jpg" alt="monk" width="469" height="319" align="right" />
	<p id="emphasis">I saw a picture of you in a monk robe. Are you a monk?</p>
	<p>No, I am not a monk. But I received full ordination from the Sangha of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Bowonniwet_Vihara">Wat Bowonniwet Vihara</a> in the summer of 2008. Prior to that I have been in and out of the robe as a novice monk several times since I was nine. Becoming a monk for a finite period of time is a form of moral training in Thailand. During my monastic time, I completed the highest level of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanam_Luang_Dhamma_Studies">Sanam Luang Dharma Study</a> curriculum (customarily for monks of ten vassas and over) when I was fourteen, becoming one of the youngest to pass the exam.</p>
	<img src="./books.png" alt="books" width="500" height="415" align="left" />
	<p id="emphasis">You wrote books?</p>
	<p>In senior year of high school, I served as the president of my high school's mathematics club.
	Because our high school (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triam_Udom_Suksa_School">Traim Udom Suksa School</a>) 
	was well-known, and we had a lot of talented math students in the club, we afforded the credibility to publish a 
	handbook for high school's mathematics. I contributed a fair bit of the book and served as an editor. 
	The book title is "lek" (literally "math").	The book was distributed by 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.chulabook.com/">Chulalongkorn University Book Center</a>, which has branches nationwide.</p>
	<p>In summer between my high school and college, I had a couple of months free before college started,
	so me and my friends, who were free and also waiting for school to start, got together and wrote
	a book on how to get into American colleges. We did this to fill the gap for Thai students to learn
	about the specifics of American college admissions system. I was the editor and one of the main contributors of the book,
	so they put my name on the cover as "Jarupon Sathirapongsasuti and friends".</p>
	<p>The book was published by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raklukegroup.com/">Rakluke Family Group</a>, a leading Thai 
	publisher, and was distributed nationally by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.se-ed.com/">SE-ED</a>. It was so well received
	that the publisher published it twice, and the book became a bestseller in educational category.</p>
