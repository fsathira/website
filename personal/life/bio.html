<h1 id="header">Biographical Sketches</h1>
<h3 id="subheader">Academic</h3>

<div align="left">
	<p>I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. 
	Receiving the King's Scholarship, I attended Stanford University and completed 
	a BS with Honors in Mathematical and Computational Science and a co-terminal MS
	in Computer Science. 
	Currently I am a doctoral student in the department of Biostatistics,
	Harvard University, working with Prof. Curtis Huttenhower on the Human Microbiome Project 
	and with Prof. John Quackenbush on integrative genomic analysis of COPD.
	My future aspiration is to realize personalized medicine and make genome technology available
	to everyone.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="subheader">Non-academic</h3>

<div align="left">
	<p>I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. Scoring highest in a national 
	examination, I received the King's Scholarship to study abroad in the US. 
	In my four years at Stanford University, I completed a BS with Honors in Mathematical 
	and Computational Science and a MS in Computer Science and studied abroad in Japan
	for six months.</p>
	<p>I'm a resident tutor at Adams House, one of the twelves undergraduate houses at Harvard College.
	Taking on a multitude of roles, I serve as an academic advisor to a group of sophomores, organize 
	science activities (e.g. problem set nights, science tables, pre-graduate school advising), and 
	take care of my residents, and engage students in intellectual and personal conversations during meal time.</p>
	<p>In my "spare" time, I practice Kyudo, play lacrosse, swim, take pictures, 
	advise undergraduate students, and meditate. 
	In a sentence, I identify myself with: applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, genomics, Buddhism, religious pluralism, 
	the meaning of life, Phi Psi, Kyudo, musicals, photography, Japan, and Thailand.</p>
