<h1 id="header">Biographical Sketches</h1>
<h3 id="subheader">Academic</h3>

<div align="left">
	<p>I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. 
	Receiving the King's Scholarship, I attended Stanford University and completed 
	a BS with Honors in Mathematical and Computational Science and a co-terminal MS
	in Computer Science. 
	Currently I am a doctoral student in the department of Biostatistics,
	Harvard University, working with Prof. Curtis Huttenhower on the Human Microbiome Project 
	and with Prof. John Quackenbush on integrative genomic analysis of COPD.
	My future aspiration is to realize personalized medicine and make genome technology available
	to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="subheader">Non-academic</h3>

<div align="left">
	<p>I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. Scoring highest in a national 
	examination, I received the King's Scholarship to study in the US. 
	In my four years at Stanford, I completed a BS with Honors in Mathematical 
	and Computational Science and a MS in Computer Science, studied abroad in Japan
	for six months, joined Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, section-led CS106A/B/X and CS107 
	for three years, and taught two Student Initiated Courses my Senior Spring.</p>
	<p>As a PhD student in Biostatistics at Harvard, I published seven papers (three
	as lead authors) on diverse topics surrounding computational genomics. I love all
	of my project but am most proud of my involvement with the Human Microbiome
	Project, the equivalent of the Human Genome Project for Microbiology.
	At Harvard, I moonlight as a Resident Tutor at Adams House where I serve as 
	academic advisor and build a community of scholars and friends.</p>
	<p>In my "spare" time, I practice Kyudo, play lacrosse, swim, sail, row,
	and meditate. In addition to making the world a better place though my mathematical, 
	statistical, and computational skills, I like to be a constant source of joy and
	energy for everyone around me.  After all, I was born on Sunday.</p>
